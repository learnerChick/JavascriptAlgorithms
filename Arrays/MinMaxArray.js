/**
 * Write a function to find the min and max in an array with minimum comparisons.
 * Solution: Compare in pairs
 * If n is odd, then initialize min and max = arr[0]. Counter (index pos for array) begins at 1 here.
 * If n is even, the initialize min = arr[0] and max = arr[1].  Counter begins at 2 here.
 * Then, start going through each element and compare min and max
 * Time complexity: 0(n)
 * Comparisons: We're doing 3 comparisons every time, and since we're going down the route of 2 numbers each time, divide that by half.
 * 3*(n-1)/2 ~1.5n

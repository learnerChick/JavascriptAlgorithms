/**
 *  Bubble sort - compare each item with the item next to it and swap is left is larger than right.  Continue to the end
 *  of the list and then reloop again.
 *
 *  Runs in 0(N^2)
 *  1) Start at the end of the array for the outer loop.
 *  2) Have another loop that starts from beginning to end of outer loop
 *  3) Now, in the inner loop, take each item and compare it to the item next to it.  If item on left is larger than right, swap.
 *  4) These swapping motions will move the bigger item to the right one by one..

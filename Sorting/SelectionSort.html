/**
 * Different from bubble sort because the sorted element(smallest) will end up being placed on the left first.  It is
 * more efficient than bubble sort because although there are n^2 comparisons, the swaps are O(N).
 *
 * Selection sort is called selection sort because you look at each item one by one, compare its value and then finally choose the smallest to swap
 * it with.
 *
 * 1) Start from the left for the outer loop.  End the loop at < length - 1.
 * 2) Set the min to the position of the outer loop's marker.
 * 3) Start the inner loop at outerloop + 1.  End at  < length.
 * 4) Compare inner loop with min.  If inner loop item is less than min, then replace min marker with inner loop marker.
 * 5) At the close of inner loop, swap the min with the current outer loop's index.  Continue.
